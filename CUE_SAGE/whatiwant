3.what_we_do 
    Morning team. Great initiative and ideas👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾 I am thinking that to solve anything we ought to first ensure we are solving a 'NEED' not a 'WANT' Thus we must ask ourselves what gaps exist in universities both at the faculty and student levels. From where I sit, I am thinking in the line of;
1.Mental Health awareness
2.Drug and substance abuse
3.Job Shadowing
4.Climate resilience and adaptation

I bet we can develop programs under these and other portfolios subject to the goals and objectives of the SAGE group
